### AIM
<br>
```
- The primary aim is to make a browser application with it's own packages & built-in plugins which has better UI and is more UX appropriate for quick working.
- Secondary aim is to be able to make smart cache memory management so it occupies lesser space on the PC.
- Tertiary aim is to make appropriate themes for browser available with an "ease to change" rather than asking the user to make multiple steps to enable/disable a theme. We may also look forward to involve settings which may help a user to manually create themes ensuring ease with "NO-CODE-INTERFACE".
